 LRC & YouTube Player
A simple webpage that loads LRC files with the video of the song from Youtube.
</br>
The Text document has the information needed for this. It contains the name of the LRC file and its music link from youtube, I came up with this idea becasue I wanted to share my own lyrics collection with their Music, downloading th song files to attach them does not seem a good idea because the channels need people to see ads for support, as well as the copyright issues.
</br>
The lyrics from here may be used to contribute to platforms that support line-by-line lyrics as well as those with plain text option after converting them to plain text format. You can do so by just loading the song and copy its lyrics, if you want the LRC click download and open the file as a Text file in your note pad to copy the lyrics with their LRC timestamps.
</br>
You make convert the downloaded LRC file to SRT or any subtitling format, and add it to the song video if you would like to do Music lyrics videos.
</br>
In general this is just an experiment with this idea, there are most of the lyrics I have at https://github.com/abdelhaqueidali/Amazigh-Lyrics-Files-LRC It has more than 90 LRC Lyrics files.

Note that I only did the prompts and AI, specifically Claude Sonnet 3.5, did the rest.
